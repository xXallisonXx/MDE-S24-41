There are two Vivado projects here:
    - usp_rf_data_converter_0_ex:
        If you put the data converter ip block in then this is the reference design that you can generate once the block is configured (one adc, one dac)
    -project_high_memory_1_adc_1_dac
        - This is the hardware config used in our final design, it has one adc and one dac, but expands the BRAM allocation and address space for each data     
         converter

Look in the "Generated Bitsreams" folder for the project_high_memory_1_adc_1_dac and the usp_rf_data_converter_new_clocks_mixer_complex, which includes a hardware configuration for a complex mixer on the ADCs as well.

The generate_chirp file can be used to generate a custom signal using MATLAB, and then using the MATLAB to TDMS tool (XILINX) to use with RF Analyzer.  

The included .mat file is an example of our chirp signal we used that was generated by the generate_chirp.m file.
